                Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly referred to as BMW, is a German multinational corporate manufacturer
                of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Germany. Founded in 7 March 1916.
                
                Bavarian Engine Works Company. The name harks back to the company’s origin in the German state of Bavaria.
                It also indicates BMW's original product range: engines for various applications.
                
                Today's BMW AG has its origin in Rapp-Motorenwerke GmbH, which began producing aircraft engines in 1913.
                During the First World War, Rapp supplied the air force of the German Empire.
                
                When the Otto company went bankrupt in 1916, it became Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG (BFW).
                Shortly afterwards, Rapp also changed its company name: In 1917, the company became known as Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH.
                BMW’s origin in the Rapp company can also be seen on the logo.
